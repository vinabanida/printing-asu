# For boundary cases, where it is not possible to draw, print "false". If your code print some of the output and then prints "false" then it will be considered as failed!!!!!!!!

submit via CANVAS in a ZIP FILE(folder) including asu.pl and README.txt

Grading will be based on the following criteria:

    a. Whether you code satisfies the functional requirements (70%).
    
    b. Boundary case checking (10%)
    
    c. Comment (20%)


a. There are four boundary case. Each will contain 2.5% (of the 10% marks assigned). Check them before you start drawing.

b. Drawing the box and 'A' will be shown in the class. Follow that to draw the other characters.
